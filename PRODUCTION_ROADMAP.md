|------|------------|
| **MongoDB downtime** | Use Atlas with 3-node replica set |
| **API overload** | Rate limiting + auto-scaling |
| **CAPTCHA failures** | Multiple solving services, proxy rotation |
| **Data loss** | Continuous backups + point-in-time restore |
| **Slow scraping** | Multiple workers + residential proxies |
| **Poor lead quality** | Scoring algorithm + filters |

## Go/No-Go Decision

**Ready to deploy if:**
- ‚úÖ API authentication implemented
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting active
- ‚úÖ Logging to file enabled
- ‚úÖ Health checks passing
- ‚úÖ MongoDB production cluster ready
- ‚úÖ Docker images built and tested
- ‚úÖ SSL/TLS configured
- ‚úÖ Smoke tests pass

**Do NOT deploy if:**
- ‚ùå No authentication (public API vulnerable)
- ‚ùå No rate limiting (can be overwhelmed)
- ‚ùå No health checks (can't monitor uptime)
- ‚ùå Using SQLite (won't scale)
- ‚ùå No backups configured (risk data loss)
