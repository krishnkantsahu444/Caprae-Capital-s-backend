# âœ… requirements.txt - CORRECTED

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Issue:** File had corruption with duplicate entries and garbled text  
**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ FIXED

---

## What Was Wrong

The `requirements.txt` file had severe corruption:
- Duplicate package entries (e.g., `selenium==4.19.0` appeared 4 times)
- Garbled text with spaces between characters (e.g., `b e a u t i f u l s o u p 4`)
- Mixed-up lines and formatting issues
- Packages appearing multiple times with different versions

---

## What Was Fixed

Created a clean `requirements.txt` with proper formatting and no duplicates.
