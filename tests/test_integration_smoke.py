"""Integration smoke test for end-to-end scraping workflow.

This test runs a small scrape to verify:
1. Crawlee spider can access Google Maps
2. Card parsing works
3. Detail page enrichment works
4. Phone normalization works
5. DB upsert works
6. At least one complete record is saved

Run with: RUN_INTEGRATION=true pytest tests/test_integration_smoke.py -v -s

NOTE: This test is slow (~30-60 seconds) and makes real network requests.
      Skip in CI unless RUN_INTEGRATION=true is set.
