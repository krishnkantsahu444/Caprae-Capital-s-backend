## 🎯 Immediate Next Actions (Optional - Can Skip)

### Option A: Test Analytics API Endpoints (15 minutes)

**1. Start FastAPI Server:**
```bash
cd c:\Users\LawLight\OneDrive\Desktop\Caprae-Capital-s-backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

**2. Open Swagger UI:**
```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

**3. Test These Endpoints:**
- `GET /analytics/summary` - Overall statistics
- `GET /analytics/top_leads?tier=HOT&limit=10` - Top HOT leads
- `GET /analytics/completeness_stats` - Field completeness
- `GET /analytics/tier_distribution` - HOT/WARM/COLD/LOW breakdown
- `GET /analytics/counts` - Businesses per category/location

**Why Test Now?**
- Verify endpoints work correctly
- See MongoDB aggregation pipelines in action
- Confirm indexes are being used

**Why Skip?**
- Tests already passed (4/4)
- Can test after Lead Scoring is implemented (will have more data)
- Focus on increasing evaluation score first

## 🚀 Priority Next: Lead Scoring Implementation (Feature A)

**Goal:** Increase evaluation score from **17/40 → 20/40** (+3 points)

### Why Lead Scoring Next?

1. **Highest Impact:** +3 points (most valuable remaining feature)
2. **Foundation Ready:** Feature F set up all the infrastructure (indexes, analytics endpoints)
3. **Clear ROI:** HOT/WARM/COLD/LOW tiers make leads actionable
4. **Quick Win:** Code already designed in `EVALUATION_CRITERIA_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

### What Lead Scoring Does

**Scoring System (100 points total):**
- **Completeness (25%):** Has phone, website, email, hours, services
- **Reputation (30%):** Rating ≥4.5 + reviews ≥50
- **Engagement (20%):** Recent reviews, services offered
- **Freshness (15%):** Data recency
- **Location (10%):** Geographic factors

**4-Tier Classification:**
- 🔥 **HOT (80-100):** Immediate action leads
- 🟡 **WARM (60-79):** High-potential leads
- 🔵 **COLD (40-59):** Standard leads
- ⚪ **LOW (0-39):** Poor quality leads

### Implementation Steps

**Day 1-2: Core Scoring (6-8 hours)**

1. **Create Lead Scoring Service** (2 hours)
   ```
   File: app/domain/services/lead_scoring.py
   Status: Code already designed, just needs to be created
   ```

2. **Create Scoring Celery Tasks** (2 hours)
   ```
   File: app/infrastructure/queue/tasks/scoring_tasks.py
   Functions:
   - score_business_task(business_id) - Score single business
   - batch_score_businesses_task(limit) - Score all businesses
   ```

3. **Create Scoring API Endpoints** (2 hours)
   ```
   File: app/presentation/api/v1/routes/scoring.py
   Endpoints:
   - POST /scoring/score/{business_id} - Trigger scoring
   - POST /scoring/batch - Score all businesses
   - GET /scoring/status/{business_id} - Check scoring status
   ```

4. **Integrate with Scrapers** (1 hour)
   ```
   Modify: app/crawlers/google_maps_crawlee.py
   Change: After saving business, trigger scoring task
   ```

5. **Testing** (1 hour)
   ```
   Create: test_lead_scoring.py
   Test: All scoring components, tier classification
   ```

### Files to Create (5 files)

1. ✅ **app/domain/services/lead_scoring.py** (200 lines)
   - Code already designed
   - 5 scoring components
   - Tier classification logic

2. ✅ **app/infrastructure/queue/tasks/scoring_tasks.py** (100 lines)
   - Celery task integration
   - Background scoring

3. ✅ **app/presentation/api/v1/routes/scoring.py** (150 lines)
   - 3 API endpoints
   - Score triggering

4. ✅ **test_lead_scoring.py** (150 lines)
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests

5. ✅ **LEAD_SCORING_STATUS_REPORT.md** (documentation)

### Expected Outcome

**After Lead Scoring:**
- ✅ Every business automatically scored on save
- ✅ 4-tier classification (HOT/WARM/COLD/LOW)
- ✅ Analytics endpoints now showing real tier data
- ✅ API can filter by tier
- ✅ Evaluation score: **17/40 → 20/40** (+3 points)
