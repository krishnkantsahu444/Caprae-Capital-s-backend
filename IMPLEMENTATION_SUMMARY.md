```

### 3. Core Components

#### **app/utils/config.py**
- Centralized environment variable loading with `python-dotenv`
- Configuration for DB path, proxy list, user agents, headless mode, delays
- Helper functions for path resolution

#### **app/utils/anti_bot.py**
- `Rotation` class for round-robin proxy and UA rotation
- Random delay generator (1-3.5s default)
- Default user agent list as fallback
- File loader for proxies and user agents

#### **app/db.py**
- SQLite database with `businesses` table
- Thread-safe connection management
- `save_business()` with automatic deduplication (unique `google_maps_url`)
- Helper functions: `get_all_businesses()`, `get_business_count()`, `business_exists()`
- Index on `google_maps_url` for fast lookups

#### **app/parsers.py**
- `parse_card_html()` — Extract business cards from search results
- `parse_detail_page()` — Extract website and hours from detail pages
- Defensive parsing with multiple selector fallbacks
- Structured extraction: name, address, phone, rating, reviews, category, etc.

#### **app/crawlers/google_maps_crawlee.py**
- `GoogleMapsCrawlee` class using Playwright via Crawlee
- **Anti-bot features:**
  - Proxy rotation (round-robin from `proxies.txt`)
  - User agent randomization (from `user_agents.txt` or defaults)
  - Random delays between requests (configurable)
  - CAPTCHA/blocking detection
  - Headless mode (configurable)
- **Scraping workflow:**
  1. Build Google Maps search URL
  2. Launch Playwright browser with proxy and UA
  3. Wait for results to load
  4. Scroll results panel to load lazy content
  5. Parse business cards with BeautifulSoup
  6. Visit detail pages to enrich with website/hours
  7. Save to database with deduplication
- **Context manager support** for resource cleanup

### 4. Celery Integration

#### **app/celery_tasks/tasks.py**
Added new task: `scrape_leads_from_google_maps_crawlee`

```python
@celery_app.task(bind=True, name="scrape_leads_from_google_maps_crawlee", max_retries=3, soft_time_limit=900)
def scrape_leads_from_google_maps_crawlee(self, query: str, location: str, options: Optional[dict] = None) -> dict
```

**Features:**
- Accepts query, location, and options (max_results, headless)
- Runs Crawlee scraper with anti-bot measures
- Saves results directly to SQLite
- Returns statistics (results_count, query, location)
- Automatic retry on failure (max 3 retries, 30s countdown)

### 5. FastAPI Endpoints

#### **app/routers/scraper.py**
Added new endpoints:

1. **POST** `/scrape/crawlee/async`
   - Trigger Crawlee scraper
   - Body: `{"query": "coffee shop", "location": "SF", "max_results": 20, "headless": true}`
   - Returns: `{"task_id": "...", "status": "PENDING"}`

2. **GET** `/scrape/crawlee/task/{task_id}`
   - Poll task status
   - Returns: `{"task_id": "...", "status": "SUCCESS", "result": {...}}`

3. **GET** `/scrape/database/leads?limit=100&offset=0`
   - Query database for scraped leads
   - Returns paginated results with total count

### 6. Documentation

#### **README.md**
Comprehensive documentation including:
- ✅ Feature overview and comparison (Selenium vs Crawlee)
- ✅ Installation steps with Playwright browser setup
- ✅ Configuration guide (.env variables, proxies, user agents)
- ✅ API endpoint documentation with examples
- ✅ Database schema and deduplication strategy
- ✅ Testing instructions
- ✅ Architecture overview
- ✅ Production deployment guide
- ✅ Anti-ban best practices
- ✅ Troubleshooting section
- ✅ Scaling tips

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### Anti-Bot Measures (Production-Ready)
1. ✅ **Proxy rotation** — Round-robin from `proxies.txt`
2. ✅ **User agent randomization** — From `user_agents.txt` or defaults
3. ✅ **Random delays** — 1-3.5s between requests (configurable)
4. ✅ **CAPTCHA detection** — Checks for blocking indicators
5. ✅ **Headless mode** — Runs without visible browser (production default)
6. ✅ **Scroll simulation** — Loads lazy-loaded content
7. ✅ **Browser fingerprinting** — Disables automation features

### Data Quality
1. ✅ **Automatic deduplication** — Uses `google_maps_url` as unique key
2. ✅ **Detail page enrichment** — Visits business pages for website/hours
3. ✅ **Defensive parsing** — Multiple selector fallbacks
4. ✅ **Structured extraction** — Validates and cleans data

### Reliability
1. ✅ **Database persistence** — SQLite with thread-safe connections
2. ✅ **Celery retry logic** — Auto-retry on failures (3x with 30s delay)
3. ✅ **Resource cleanup** — Proper browser closure via context managers
4. ✅ **Error handling** — Try/except blocks with logging

### Scalability
1. ✅ **Async task execution** — Celery + Redis for distributed processing
2. ✅ **Pagination** — Database API supports limit/offset
3. ✅ **Configurable limits** — Max results, delays, etc.
4. ✅ **Ready for PostgreSQL** — Easy migration path from SQLite

## 📋 Next Steps (User Actions Required)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m playwright install chromium
```

### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings
```

### 3. Set Up Proxies (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
# Create proxies.txt with one proxy per line
# Format: http://proxy.example.com:8080
```

### 4. Start Services
```bash
# Terminal 1: Redis
redis-server

# Terminal 2: Celery worker
celery -A app.celery_tasks.tasks worker --loglevel=info

# Terminal 3: FastAPI server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 9000
```

### 5. Test the Integration
```bash
# Use the API at http://localhost:9000/docs
# Try POST /scrape/crawlee/async with a small max_results (5-10)
# Check the database: sqlite3 leads.db "SELECT * FROM businesses;"
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Existential Risks (Mitigated)
1. ✅ **Immediate bans** — Proxy rotation and delays implemented
2. ✅ **Hidden failures** — Robust logging and error handling added
3. ✅ **Resource leaks** — Context managers ensure cleanup
4. ✅ **Data quality failure** — Deduplication and validation in place
5. ✅ **Deployment surprise** — README documents Playwright browser installation

### Known Limitations
1. **Google Maps selectors change frequently** — Parser may need updates
2. **SQLite concurrency** — Limited to ~100 concurrent writes (use PostgreSQL for scale)
3. **Proxy quality matters** — Use residential proxies for best results
4. **Rate limiting** — Google may still block if too aggressive (adjust delays)

### Production Readiness Checklist
- [x] Anti-bot measures implemented
- [x] Database persistence with deduplication
- [x] Error handling and retry logic
- [x] Configuration via environment variables
- [x] Comprehensive documentation
- [ ] **User action required:** Install Playwright browsers

## 🔧 Technical Debt

### Future Improvements
1. Add unit tests for parsers (use fixtures with sample HTML)
2. Add integration tests for Crawlee scraper (use mock Google Maps responses)
3. Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL for production
4. Add webhook notifications for task completion
5. Build Flower dashboard for Celery monitoring
6. Add CSV/Excel export functionality
7. Implement job queue UI for lead management
8. Add custom enrichment scraper (replace Apollo)
